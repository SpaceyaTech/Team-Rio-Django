## Overview

The SpaceYaTech Content Management system is an open-application that lets users to quickly publish content and share it with ease to their audience. Inspired by existing CMSes like Hashnode, Wordpress, DEV and Joomla, we felt the need to create an African CMS created by young Africans looking to learn by contributing to Open Source. SpaceYaTech opted for a CMS as the debut open source project because of the technicalities involved in creating, maintaining and scaling a CMS. A CMS poses great technical challenges and a great learning opportunity for those looking to grow their tech skills.
For a more detailed overview of the project, read through the [CMS Backend wiki](https://github.com/SpaceyaTech/CMS-Backend-Repository/wiki)

## Commit message template

Just so that we have all our commit messages to be more readable and sensible it is recomended we use a template for the commit messages. Here is a [commit message template](https://github.com/SpaceyaTech/Team-Rio-Django/wiki/Commit-Messages) that one should follow when making your Contributions

## PhoneNumberField

In order to use **PhoneNumber_field** for localization option, perform the following:

- Install phonenumber minimal metadata

```bash
pip install "django-phonenumber-field[phonenumberslite]"
```

or

- Install phonenumber extended features (e.g. geocoding)

```bash
pip install "django-phonenumber-field[phonenumbers]"
```

- Add `phonenumber_field` to the list of the installed apps in your `settings.py` file INSTALLED_APPS:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # Other appsâ€¦
    "phonenumber_field",
]
```

- Model field section add the following:

```python
from phonenumber_field.modelfields import PhoneNumberField

phone_number = PhoneNumberField(blank=True)
```


## AUTHENTICATION

For authentication you follow this instructions:

- Since we are using djangorest framework. Install the django rest framework library and add it to the INSTALLED_APPS as a third party app.

- Create the serializers by adding a new file in your accounts app and name it serializers.py

- In the serializers file create the needed serializers in this case , UserSerializer, RegisterSerializer, AddAccountSerializer.

- Create the api views in the views.py file in the accounts app. In this case the UserView, RegisterView, AddAccountView

- Create the corresponding urls by creating a urls.py file in your accounts app. Make sure to include your app urls in your projects urls.py file in the following way

```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    #Other patterns

    path("", include("accounts.urls"))
]
```

- Install the djangorestframework jwt library

```bash

pip install djangorestframework_simplejwt
```

- In your projects settings.py configure the REST_FRAMEWORK settings to use JWT and set the AUTH_HEADER_TYPE as JWT. For the access token lifetime i've set it to 1 day for testing purposes.

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
    ),
}

SIMPLE_JWT = {
   'AUTH_HEADER_TYPES': ('JWT',),
   'ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(days=1),
}

```

- In your urls.py add the following:

```python
from rest_framework_simplejwt import views as jwt_views

urlpatterns = [
    #Other patterns

    path('api/token/', jwt_views.TokenObtainPairView.as_view(), name='token_obtain_pair'),
    path('api/token/refresh/', jwt_views.TokenRefreshView.as_view(), name='token_refresh'),
    ]

```

- Add various permissions to your apis in the views.py file.

## To Run and Create unittests

Add your tests in the test file in the test folder which is located in the app you want to test.  
To run all tests  
```python
python3 manage.py test
```
To run tests in a particular app


```bash
python3 manage.py test [appname]
```

## Creating the blog Api

The blog api **{{baseurl}}/blog/**
shows a list of all available blog posts (Stori/Mastori)
The model naming is abitrary and can be subject to change if need be
Ther is also need to filter out the various blogposts in relation ti their tittle or date posted hence the filter

## Blog admin

Here the implementation is more similar to the api but for the admin the search fields are title and content
```python
  search_fields = ['title', 'content']
```
theres also an addition of a slug field this is in anticipation of creation of the detail view 
the slug could be used to generate more elaborate urls for specific blogposts (mastori)
Filtering has also been implemented here by filtering on the basis of the post ststus
```python
 list_filter = ("status",)
 ```
 here a post is either a draft or published
